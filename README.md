## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### **Code Standards**

#### **Dart/Flutter Standards**

```dart
// Follow official Dart style guide
// Use effective Dart practices
// Implement proper null safety
// Maintain consistent naming conventions

// Example service structure
class ArtworkService {
  static final ArtworkService _instance = ArtworkService._internal();
  factory ArtworkService() => _instance;
  ArtworkService._internal();

  Future<List<ArtworkModel>> fetchArtworks({
    String? userId,
    int limit = 20,
    Map<String, dynamic>? filters,
  }) async {
    // Implementation with error handling
    // Logging and analytics
    // Proper null safety
  }
}
```

#### **Architecture Patterns**

- **MVVM Pattern**: Model-View-ViewModel separation
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Service Layer**: Business logic encapsulation
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper service instantiation

### **Package Development Rules**
