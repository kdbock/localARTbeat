This document is intended to support an in-person, exploratory conversation with Visit Kinston regarding Local ARTbeat.  

No immediate commitment is requested. This material is provided to ground the discussion in shared facts and practical considerations. 

What the App Actually Does (Visitor-Facing Overview) 

Shows nearby public art and walkable points of interest 

Connects art locations to shops, restaurants, and events 

Suggests routes that encourage multi-stop downtown exploration 

Works best when visitors are physically present downtown 

What It Encourages 

Walking instead of driving 

Visiting multiple businesses per trip 

Filling time between meals, events, and hotel check-in 

Exploring beyond a single destination 

What It Is Not 

Not a booking platform 

Not social media 

Not a replacement for tourism marketing 

 

What Local ARTbeat Is Seeking to Explore 

Local ARTbeat is seeking guidance and potential support in the following areas: 

Whether Local ARTbeat qualifies as a tourism-appropriate program under TDA guidelines 

Whether a pilot-level investment is an appropriate next step 

What funding mechanisms or timelines may apply 

How Local ARTbeat could best complement existing Visit Kinston efforts 

This conversation is about fit and feasibility, not a finalized funding request. 

 

Potential Scope of Support (If Aligned) 

If Local ARTbeat aligns with Visit Kinston’s priorities, the proposed scope of support would focus on visitor-facing execution, including: 

Guided downtown art walks 

On-site visitor engagement and wayfinding 

Integration with existing festivals and tourism events 

Reusable infrastructure that supports future tourism programming 

The mobile application is already built and live. 
Support would focus on activation and delivery, not development. 

Preliminary Funding Range (Pilot Phase) 

Exploratory funding range: 

$25,000–$40,000 

This range reflects: 

A regional pilot, not a permanent operational commitment 

Bounded, one-season support 

Costs directly tied to tourism activation and visitor engagement 

Final scope and amounts would be determined collaboratively, if appropriate. 

What We Are Not Asking For 

To be clear, Local ARTbeat is not seeking funding for: 

Software or app development 

Ongoing platform maintenance 

Personal income replacement 

Long-term staffing obligations 

Non-visitor-facing overhead 

Core planning, management, and platform upkeep are currently supported through in-kind contributions. 

What Success Would Look Like 

If supported, success for this pilot would be evaluated through: 

Tour and event participation 

Visitor engagement during festivals and weekends 

Downtown activity and partner feedback 

Repeat participation across multiple events 

These indicators align with Heads in Beds objectives by encouraging longer, more engaged visits. 

A Place-Based Tourism Tool to Increase Downtown Visits, Visit Length, and Overnight Stays 

Purpose 

Local ARTbeat is a place-based tourism initiative designed to increase downtown visit length, encourage walkable exploration, and support overnight stays by structuring how visitors experience a community once they arrive. 

The program combines guided downtown art walks, regional event integration, and a public-facing discovery app to help convert short, single-stop visits into longer, more engaged downtown experiences. 

Local ARTbeat is already built and live on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. 

Why This Matters for Tourism (Heads in Beds) 

Tourism performance is driven less by raw visitation numbers and more by visitor behavior, including: 

How long visitors stay downtown 

How many activities and businesses they engage with 

Whether visits convert from day trips to overnight stays 

Whether visitors return for future events 

Tourism and downtown economic research consistently shows that walkable districts, clustered destinations, and structured visitor activities are associated with: 

Increased time spent downtown 

Higher per-visit spending on food, shopping, and entertainment 

Greater likelihood of overnight accommodation 

Local ARTbeat is designed specifically to influence these behaviors once visitors are already in town. 

Walkability and Downtown Engagement 

Walkability is a key predictor of visitor engagement and dwell time. 

Walk Score® data shows Kinston’s citywide average is car-dependent (Walk Score 31), while the downtown core can score in the ‘Very Walkable’ range (Walk Score 79–80 along the N Queen St corridor), supporting multi-stop visitor itineraries on foot. Walkable downtowns support multi-stop visitation, which is correlated with increased spending and longer stays. 

For tourism purposes, this matters because walkable environments: 

Encourage exploration beyond a single destination 

Reduce time gaps between meals, events, and activities 

Support spontaneous visits to shops and restaurants 

Local ARTbeat intentionally routes visitors on foot, reinforcing existing downtown infrastructure rather than requiring new construction or transportation investment. 

Why Kinston Works as a Hub 

Kinston is positioned not as a competitor to larger Eastern North Carolina cities, but as a functional regional hub for downtown-based visitor exploration. 

Key characteristics that support this role include: 

A compact, walkable downtown suitable for guided and self-guided tours 

Existing public art and cultural assets that can be activated without new capital investment 

Hotel availability that supports weekend and event-based stays 

Central geographic location relative to multiple ENC communities 

An established calendar of festivals and community events 

From a tourism development perspective, Kinston functions effectively as: 

A base location for regional exploration 

A repeat-visit destination rather than a one-time stop 

A connector between events, dining, and cultural activity 

Local ARTbeat strengthens this role by giving visitors clear, structured reasons to move through downtown, linger longer, and return. 

Program Structure: Spring–Fall 2026 

ENC Capture Tour 

26 guided downtown art walks across Eastern North Carolina 

Weekly tours running March through September 2026 

Each tour activates walkable downtown areas and nearby businesses 

Kinston included as a featured location 

These tours are designed to create predictable, repeat visitation patterns, rather than one-off events. 

Festival & Event Integration 

Local ARTbeat is designed to integrate with existing festivals and markets by: 

Providing structured downtown activities for visitors already in town 

Encouraging visitors to stay longer before or after events 

Extending the economic impact of existing tourism investments 

What Local ARTbeat Supports 

Local ARTbeat functions as visitor infrastructure, not a replacement for tourism marketing. It supports tourism goals by: 

Increasing downtown visit length 

Encouraging walk-based exploration 

Supporting repeat visitation tied to events 

Strengthening the connection between festivals, dining, and overnight stays 

The platform is designed to scale incrementally while remaining reusable across seasons and events. 

Alignment with Visit Kinston & TDA Goals 

Local ARTbeat aligns with Heads in Beds priorities by: 

Encouraging longer, more engaged visits 

Supporting weekend and event-driven overnight stays 

Increasing the economic impact of existing festivals and attractions 

Providing a low-risk, reusable tourism engagement tool 

The pilot model allows for evaluation before any long-term commitment.
