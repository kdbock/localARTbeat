# Artist Boost User Guide 🚀

## What Are Boosts?

Boosts are digital platform items that amplify artists' visibility and discovery momentum across ArtBeat. When you send a Boost, you activate immediate in-app effects that increase an artist's presence in discovery features, search results, and community engagement.

Boosts are designed to help artists gain traction within the platform while giving you visible recognition for your participation in the community.

Momentum Explained

Momentum represents an artist’s current discovery energy on ArtBeat.

How Momentum Works

Momentum rises through Boosts and organic activity

Momentum naturally decreases over time

Higher momentum improves placement across the platform

Organic actions (follows, interactions, sales) add smaller momentum amounts

Momentum Levels

0–100: Standard visibility

100–500: Enhanced local discovery

500–1000: Regional trending

1000–2500: Broad platform visibility

2500+: Featured discovery status

## Artist Earnings & Revenue Sharing

**How It Works**:

Boosts are digital platform items. When you purchase a Boost:

1. The platform processes the in-app purchase through Apple/Google
2. Artist participation is recorded and tracked
3. Artists accumulate an **earnings balance** through ArtBeat's creator revenue sharing program
4. Earnings are tracked in the artist's earnings dashboard under "Boost Earnings"
5. Artists can request payouts once minimum thresholds are met
6. Payouts are processed off-platform through the creator program

**Key Points**:
- Artists view earnings in their ArtBeat dashboard
- Revenue is shared through the platform's creator program
- Minimum payout thresholds apply
- Processing time varies based on payment method
- All transactions comply with platform policies

**Note**: Boosts are non-refundable once purchased, as in-app effects occur immediately.
